= What is it? =
Auto Load Next Post is a lightweight plugin that simply loads the previous post, one after another as you scroll down the page. It simply reads the post navigation in your theme at the end of each post and collects the post URL for the previous post. WordPress will then do a partial load and place the content of the previous post underneath the parent post.

Not only that, it updates your web history by manipulating the web address and page title. This allows you to return to any post you have looked at in your browser history. When you refresh the page, the page will take you to the post you were viewing last.

= Features =
* Can restrict it to load only on specific post types. - NEW in v1.3.2
* Have the option to hide the comments if you wish. - NEW in v1.3.2
* Track each post load with Google Analytics. ( Requires Google Analytics to be applied for this to work. )

== Installation ==
Installing "Auto Load Next Post" can be done either by searching for "Auto Load Next Post" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
2. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Go to the plugin settings page 'Settings > Auto Load Next Post'.
5. Enter each of the containers specified in the theme you are using and press "Save".

Once you have activated the plugin, you may get an admin notice telling you that you have not declared support for the plugin. This is perfectly normal and with a little setting up, the notification will remove automatically. There are two buttons. The first leads you to documentation to help you support the plugin. The second allows you to force hide the admin notice.

See [documentation](https://github.com/seb86/Auto-Load-Next-Post/wiki) for more information.
